### Configure Email Functionality
Max uses [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) to send verification emails to users joining the Armada server. to work proper locally please follow these steps to create a new gmail account to locally test with:

1. Create a new gmail.com account
2. Once logged in with this account enable [less secure application access](https://myaccount.google.com/u/1/lesssecureapps?pageId=none&pli=1).
3. fill in the ```EMAIL_USERNAME``` & ```EMAIL_PASS``` values on the ```.env``` file with this new gmail account's info.


# Running the Bot

## Local

To run the bot locally ensure that you have followed the installation instructions above and have docker running.

Use docker-compose to start the container with the bot client.

```
docker-compose up
```

If all went well, and your **DEBUG_MODE** is set properly you will see a logged message of ```Bot Online and Ready!:```

Hop onto your discord server and find a room with the bot and run the command ```!help``` to see a display of optional commands.

# Style Guide

The AirBnB javascript style guide has been put in place and will be enforced through active and passive linting.

Ensure your local IDE has the ability to add eslint plugins. [Atom](https://atom.io) is recommended.

> [Source](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb#eslint-config-airbnb-1)

### Atom Configuration

Install the linter-eslint package for Atom.

```
apm install linter-eslint
```


## Confirm Linting Works

Removing a semi-colon from any line of Javascript will trigger the linter to automatically flag the edited line.

# Debug Tool Documentation

## Example of Usage

Instead of console.log() require the tool.js file
and call the .debug() method passing in three arguments
(title, output, level)

[code] to call a debug()
[code] to activate debug_mode

### title: String

Should be a string that will prefix the output
argument in the resulting console.log()

### output: Object

Any object that will be suffixed onto the title
argument in the resulting console.log()

### level: Integer

A number that indicates how fine grained the output
of this particular output should be. Reference the **Debug Level Chart**

## Debug Level Chart

0. Production Environment Level Output
1. Staging Environment Level Output
2. General Debug Information for Development
3. Very Detailed and in-depth Output.
4. Highly Fine Grained Detailed and in-depth Output.
